## Abstract
Recently, ‚Äúpre-training and fine-tuning‚Äù has been adopted as a standard workflow for many graph tasks since it can take general graph
knowledge to relieve the lack of graph annotations from each application. However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and
graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often
incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a
‚Äúnegative transfer‚Äù to the specific application, leading to poor results.
Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing
(NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging
prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting
topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically,
we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts
with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In
this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between
various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we
further study the task space of various graph applications and re-formulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward,
we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting
framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks. We
conduct extensive experiments, results from which demonstrate
the superiority of our method.
## Contributions

- We unify the prompt format in the language area and graph area, and further propose an effective graph prompt for multi-task settings
- We propose an effective way to reformulate node-level and edge-level tasks to graph-level tasks, which can further match many pre-training pretexts
- We introduce the meta-learning technique to our graph prompting study so that we can learn a reliable prompt for improving the multi-task performance
- We carefully analyze why our method works and confirm the effectiveness of our method via extensive experiments

### As a Jekyll theme

1. Add `gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies
3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file
4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a Boilerplate / Fork

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
