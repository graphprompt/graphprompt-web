To further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we
further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task.

Specifically, we reformulate node-level and edge-level tasks to graph-level tasks by building induced graphs for nodes and edges, respectively. As shown in
Figure a, an induced graph for a target node means its local area
in the network within 𝜏 distance, which is also known as its 𝜏-ego
network. This subgraph preserves the node’s local structure by
neighboring node connections and its semantic context by neighboring node features, which is the main scope of most graph neural encoders. When we treat the target node’s label as this induced
graph label, we can easily translate the node classification problem
into graph classification; Similarly, we present an induced graph for
a pair of nodes in Figure b. Here, the pair of nodes can be treated
as a positive edge if there is an edge connecting them, or a negative
edge if not. This subgraph can be easily built by extending this node
pair to their 𝜏 distance neighbors. We can reformulate the edge-level task by assigning the graph label with the edge label of the
target node pair. Note that for unweighted graphs, the 𝜏 distance is
equal to 𝜏-hop length; for weighted graphs, the 𝜏 distance refers to
the shortest path distance, where the induced graph can be easily
found by many efficient algorithms.
