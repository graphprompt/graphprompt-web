We first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from 
  NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area.

To seamlessly transfer the prompting idea from NLP to the graph domain, we propose
to unify NLP Prompt and Graph Prompt in one perspective. Having compared the demand of NLP and graph area as shown in Figure
2, we found that the prompt in NLP and graph areas should contain at least three components:
- prompt token, which contains the vectorized prompting information with the same size as the input word/node vector; 
- token structure, which indicates the connection of different tokens. In the NLP area, prompt tokens (a.k.a
prompt words) are preset as a linear relation like a sub-sentence or a phrase; whereas in the graph domain, the connections of different
tokens are non-linear and far more complicated than NLP prompts;
- inserting pattern, which presents how to add the prompt to the
input data. In the NLP area, the prompt is usually added in the front
or the back end of the input sentences by default. However, in the
graph area, there are no explicit positions like a sentence to joint
graph prompt, making the graph prompting more difficult.
